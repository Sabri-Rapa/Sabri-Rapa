### Hi there 👋

💥 I'm recently graduated as a Full-Stack Developer. I am very excited to continue delving into the world of development, which I discovered as my passion.

💨I'm entering the world of development with my first personal projects.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, OAuth, Sequelize.

🌍  I'm based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
